//functions similar to c
//return similar to c
//overloaded functions : same name for functions that is differentiated by the function signatures(function parameters are different)
//variable scope - locals are declared within a function , while globals are declared outside the function
//global variables are less secure
//arrays 
//sizeof function ( the total memory used)
//foreach loop from beginning to end//kinda useless
//passing array to functions
//searching similar to java linear and binary

//Isn't the size of each element in the array different, since "Toyota", "BMW", and 
//"Ford" have different lengths? So how can sizeof(std::string) be the same for all?
//Short Answer:
//Yes, the string lengths differ, but the size of a std::string object is fixed â€” 
//because it only stores a pointer and some metadata, not the actual character data inline.

//when array is passed it decays to a pointer and size is no longer visible, therefore pass size as well
